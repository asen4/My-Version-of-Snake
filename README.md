# My-Version-of-Snake
This game is my own modified version of the original game Snake. 
This game has two types of fruit that increase the length of the snake by a different number. (Blue Square = Blueberry & Red Square = Apple)
There are also various obstacles (i.e. yellow squares) placed at random locations on the screen. If the snake hits an obstacle, it will head in a completely new direction. Be careful!

Thanks!
Have fun!
