# My-Version-of-Snake
This game is my own modified version of the original game Snake. 
This game has two types of fruit that increase the length of the snake by a different number. As a side note, a blue square indicates a blueberry and a red square indicates, of course, an apple. 
There are also various obstacles (i.e. yellow squares) placed at random locations on the screen. If the snake hits an obstacle, it will head in a completely new direction. Be wary!

Thanks!
Have fun!
