# Snake
This game is my own modified version of the original game Snake. 
Unlike the original game, there are two different types of fruit that will appear on the screen â€” apples and blueberries. Each fruit consumed will increase the length of the snake by a different amount (i.e., blueberries = +2 and apples = +4). 
There are also various obstacles (i.e., yellow squares) placed at random locations on the screen. (They refresh with each round.) If the snake hits an obstacle, it will head in a completely new direction. Be wary!

Thanks for playing!
Have fun!
